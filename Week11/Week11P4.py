"""
A specimen has an initial diameter of 200mm and a length of 700mm.
At a stress of 40MPa and a temperature of 538 deg.C the steady state strain rate
is about 2*1eâˆ’4 % per hour. Find the primary creep elongation and the steady state
creep elongation after 5000 hours given that the creep deformation at that time is 7.2mm
