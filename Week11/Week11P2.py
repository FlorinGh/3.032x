# Problem 2

"""
You are a materials engineer recently hired by Boeing, and your first task is to
develop a new polycrystalline Ni alloy. They tell you that the parts will be
under a constant stress of about 50MPa and temperature of about 1100 degC.
The creep mechanism you are most concerned with in this application is power law creep.
How might you minimize creep rates for this application?
